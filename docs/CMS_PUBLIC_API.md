# CMS public read API — contract v1 (`/api/public/v1`)

Served by the CMS Worker (`al-ummah-now-cms[-qa|-stage]`). Consumed by www server-side through the
service binding `CMS` (`env.CMS.fetch("https://cms.internal/api/public/v1/...")`; the host is ignored
on a binding) or over HTTPS at `CMS_PUBLIC_URL`. Published rows only; a scheduled page or post (`publish_at`
still ahead) is not published yet and is absent everywhere (404, lists, alternates, sitemap) until its time,
then appears with `published_at` = the scheduled time. No field was added. JSON, UTF-8.
Headers: `Cache-Control: public, s-maxage=60, stale-while-revalidate=600`, plus `ETag`.
Errors: `{ "error": "not_found" | "bad_request", "message"?: string }` with 404 or 400.
`locale` is required where listed: `en` | `ar`; anything else → 400.

```ts
type Locale = 'en' | 'ar';

interface MediaRef {
  url: string; alt: string | null;
  width: number | null; height: number | null;   // as displayed (EXIF orientation applied) once the variant job has read the file
  variants: MediaVariants | null;                 // added in CMS-10 (additive); null until the original's width is known
}
// url is absolute: `${CMS_PUBLIC_URL}/api/public/v1/media/<path>`

// Resized copies (see "Image variants" below). Each string is a ready `srcset`:
// "<url>?w=320&f=avif 320w, <url>?w=640&f=avif 640w, …".
interface MediaVariants {
  widths: number[];                         // ascending: 320, 640, 960, 1280, 1600 below the original's width, plus its own width (≤ 1600)

| GET | Query | Response |
|---|---|---|
| `/site` | `locale` | `{ settings: SiteSettings \| null, nav: { header: NavItem[], footer: NavItem[] } }` |
| `/home` | `locale` | `{ settings: SiteSettings \| null, videos: CuratedVideo[], posts: PostSummary[] }` (videos: placement `home`, locale = l or `all`, by sort, at most 48; posts: latest 3) |
| `/pages/:slug` | `locale` | `Page` or 404 |
| `/posts` | `locale`, `page` (1-based, default 1), `limit` (1–20, default 10) | `{ items: PostSummary[], page: number, limit: number, total: number }` newest first |
| `/posts/:slug` | `locale` | `Post` or 404 |
| `/videos` | `locale`, `placement` (`home` \| `videos`, default `videos`) | `{ items: CuratedVideo[] }` (by sort, at most 48) |
| `/sitemap` | — | `{ items: { type: 'page' \| 'post', locale: Locale, slug: string, updated_at: string }[] }` (pages with show_in_sitemap only) |
| `/media/*` | — | the R2 object, `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable` |
| `/media/*` | `w` (1–1600), `f` (`avif` \| `webp` \| `jpeg` \| `png`) | the variant: `Content-Type` of `f`, immutable cache, `X-Variant: hit`. Not made yet: the **original**, `Cache-Control: public, max-age=60, s-maxage=60`, `X-Variant: pending`, and the job is queued. Malformed `w`/`f` → 400 |

The page slug `home` is reserved (not used as a page route on www). An empty CMS returns empty
arrays and `settings: null`, never an error.

## Image variants (CMS-10)

Originals are stored and served exactly as uploaded (never overwritten, CMS-1). Resized copies are
derived from them by a **queued job** and kept in R2 under `_variants/v1/<path>/<width>.<ext>`:
AVIF, WebP and a fallback (JPEG, or PNG for PNG originals) at each of `MediaVariants.widths`. No
image is ever resized inside a request.

- **Where it runs:** the CMS Worker's own queue consumer (`al-ummah-now-cms-variants[-stage|-qa]`,
  DLQ `al-ummah-now-cms-variants-dlq[-stage|-qa]`), with Squoosh's codecs compiled to WASM
  (mozjpeg, libwebp, libavif via `@jsquash/*`) and PNG/resizing in JS. Cloudflare Image
  Transformations (`/cdn-cgi/image/`, `cf.image`) are **not enabled** on the zone (Free plan)
  and Cloudflare Images is a separate paid product, so neither is used.
- **When:** right after an upload; on the first request for a variant that does not exist; and by
  the 30-minute cron, which also backfills older media, resends lost jobs and removes the
  variants of deleted originals. Deleting an original deletes its variants at once.
- **Retries / failures:** a failing job is retried with exponential backoff (30 s → 30 min, 5
  attempts); then, or at once for a permanent reason (too large: over 16 MP, 8 MP for AVIF;
  undecodable), the original is flagged to staff: the Library card says "Sizes not made" with
  the reason and a Retry, and the Overview shows how many failed. Such originals keep being
  served as uploaded.
- **For www:** use `variants` in a `<picture>`: `<source type="image/avif" srcset=avif>`,
  `<source type="image/webp" srcset=webp>`, `<img srcset=fallback src=url width height>`, with a
  `sizes` that matches the layout. Until a variant is made its URL returns the original (correct,
  just larger) with a 60-second cache, so pages never break while jobs run.

## Preview API (not public) — `/api/preview/v1`

Draft preview on www (issue #9). **Not** part of the public API above: `/api/public/v1` still serves
published rows only, with or without a token. www calls this server-side through the same service
binding, never from a browser (no CORS headers).

| GET | Header | Response |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/preview/v1/:kind/:id` (`kind`: `pages` \| `posts`) | `Authorization: Bearer <token>` | `PreviewResponse`; 401 `{ error: 'invalid_token' \| 'expired_token' }`; 404 `{ error: 'not_found' }` (row deleted) |

```ts
interface PreviewResponse {
  kind: 'page' | 'post';
  id: number;
  status: 'draft' | 'scheduled' | 'published';   // scheduled: published with publish_at still ahead
  expires_at: string;            // ISO, when the token stops working
  edit_url: string;              // the row in the CMS editor
  content: Page | Post;          // exactly the public shapes above; alternates are published rows only;
                                 // published_at falls back to created_at for a never-published draft
}
```

Every response: `Cache-Control: private, no-store`, `X-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow`,
`Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`.

**Tokens** (`src/lib/preview.ts`): `v1.<base64url(payload)>.<base64url(HMAC-SHA256)>`, payload
`{ k: 'pages' | 'posts', id, iat, exp }` (seconds), valid 30 minutes, bound to one row (a token for
another row or kind is `invalid_token`). Minted only by `GET /preview/:kind/:id` on the CMS, behind
the staff session gate (admin or editor; anyone else has no CMS session), which answers
`303 → {WWW_URL}/preview?token=…`. The HMAC key is derived from `BKND_JWT_SECRET`
(`HMAC-SHA256(BKND_JWT_SECRET, "al-ummah-now/cms/preview-token/v1")`): no extra secret, and a preview
signature can never stand in for a session one. Rotating `BKND_JWT_SECRET` ends open preview links.
www reads `k`/`id`/`exp` from the payload only to name its cookie; the CMS checks the signature on
every render, so a token can't be stretched or moved to another row.

## Home timeline feed (Workers KV)

The CMS publishes the home timeline to the KV namespace bound as `FEED` in both Workers
(`al-ummah-now-www-feed`, `-stage`, `-qa`); the CMS is the only writer. Contract:
AlUmmahNowCMS `src/lib/feed/model.ts`; www's reader `src/lib/feed.ts` must stay in step.

| Key | Value |
|---|---|
| `feed:{l}:head` | `{ v: 1, locale, build, built_at, page_size, pinned: FeedItem[], items: FeedItem[] (newest 40), more, total, weeks: { week, build, oldest, older }[], years: { year, key, count, oldest }[] }`. The pointer and the first page; the only key rewritten in place, written last in every build. |
| `feed:{l}:w:{isoWeek}:{build}` | `{ v, week, build, items: FeedItem[] (newest first), older: { week, build } \| null }`. A superseded version is overwritten once with `{ v, week, moved: <build> }` or `{ v, week, gone: true }`, then deleted after 7 days. |
| `feed:{l}:y:{isoYear}:{build}` | `{ v, year, weeks: { week, key, count, newest, oldest }[] }` (the fallback index). |

`FeedItem = { key: "p<id>" \| "v<id>", type: "post" \| "video", date, pinned, post?: PostSummary & { videos: { kind, ref_id, snapshot }[] }, video?: { kind, ref_id, snapshot, title_override } }`.
Order: date desc, then `v` before `p`, then id desc. Cursor (`?before=`):
`<ms>-<key>` optionally followed by `.<isoWeek>.<build>` (the week to read next); regex
`^(\d{1,15})-([pv]\d{1,12})(?:\.(\d{4}-W\d{2})\.([a-z0-9]{1,32}))?$`. Weeks are ISO weeks in UTC
(storage only; www labels days in the reader's zone). Reads: head with `cacheTtl` 30 s, week and
year keys 60 s (a tombstone overwrites a key once).
